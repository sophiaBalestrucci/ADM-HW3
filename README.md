Travelling is a pleasant activity which has increased since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nowadays, people look for places to visit which are attractive, affordable, with a rich history and which have recommended activities. Using user-generated content, Atlas Obscura, an American online magazine and travel firm, catalogues unusual and obscure tourist locations. The website's articles span many subjects, including history, science, cuisine, and unique places.

Our team have been hired to provide our Data Science knowledge to create a search engine which will facilitate specific searches towards a topic related to the most popular places to visit.
